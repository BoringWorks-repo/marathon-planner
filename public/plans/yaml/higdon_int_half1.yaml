description: 'Hal Higdon: Half Marathon Intermediate 1: "Half Marathon Intermediate 1 features steady running, long and short. Intermediate 1 is an endurance-based program; Intermediate 2 is a speed-based program. These two intermediate schedules exist in a parallel universe, the same level of difficulty, just slightly different approaches to training. They are part of the logical progression upward from Novice through Intermediate to Advanced for the half marathon distance. Before you buy, take a look at Intermediate 2 and also look back at Novice 2. Make sure you pick the correct program for your level of ability. If you have any doubt, err on the side of easy."
